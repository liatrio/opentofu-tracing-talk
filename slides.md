# Tracing Terraform Modules 

### Enabling Product Thinking with OpenTelemetry (and OpenTofu)

# Reusable Terraform Modules

<Transform :scale="1.7">

- Security Guardrails built-in

- Quick-Start for app teams

- Standard Architectures

</Transform>

---

# We asked: How do we measure success?

<Transform :scale="1.8">

- Are your modules being used? Which ones?

- What is the developer experience of your modules?

- Are errors reported manually or automatically?

</Transform>

---

# ...This is just Observability

<Transform :scale="1.8">

- *traces:* see speed, errors, and dependencies

- *metrics:* capture usage statistics

- *investigate* unexplained errors

</Transform>

---


# What could "Good" Look like? 

<Transform :scale="1.8">

- Instrument [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) 
- Instrument CI/CD and/or the [Flux Tofu-Controller](https://github.com/flux-iac/tofu-controller)
- Enrich telemetry with attributes from git/kubernetes

</Transform>

### This would be a boring talk if we didn't have code

- [github.com/liatrio/opentofu-tracing-talk](https://github.com/liatrio/opentofu-tracing-talk)

- *This is a PoC, but this aligns with ongoing efforts in the OTel community*

---

todo fullscreen shot of the trace to show transitive module errors

# Why this is awesome

<Transform :scale="1.7">

- Existing terraform modules require no changes.
- Recursively traces all sub-modules
- Gets all module version info, *even for unpinned modules*. 
- External API calls can be traced too ðŸ¤¯

</Transform>

TODO code-snippet that shows TRACEPARENT and tracing apply

---

<Transform :scale="1.8">

### *Tracing FTW*

- When we see an error we'll know:
  + the resource in the module that caused the error 
  + which git commit the plan/apply was run against
  + which team encountered the issue

</Transform>

# Deriving metrics

- Which modules are widely used? Prioritize!

- Are people upgrading their Terraform modules?

- Drift-Detection: Modules which change resources every run may be non-idempotent!

# What's next?

<Transform :scale="1.4">

### Environment Variable Context Propogation

- Context propogation for non-HTTP interactions **does not exist yet**
- We used an *informal but common* convention called `TRACEPARENT`
- Support for environment variable propogation is in-progress:
  + [opentelemetry-specification issue #740](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/issues/740)
  + [opentelemetry proposal PR #241](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/pull/241)

</Transform>

# What's next?

<Transform :scale="1.4">

### CI/CD Semantic Conventions
  
- We're in the OTel group for CI/CD Semantic Conventions
  + [open-telemetry/semantic-conventions issue #915](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/issues/915)
  
- This will inform Pipeline/Tofu-Controller trace attributes

</Transform>

# What's next? (takeaways)

<Transform :scale="1.4">

### Tracing isn't just for Web Services

- OTel for CI/CD and Batch is going to be a game-changer.
- *This technology will all feel obvious in retrospect.*
